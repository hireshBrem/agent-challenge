# Nosana and AI Builders Presents: BUIDL DAY @ TOKEN2049 ðŸš€

![Agent-101](./assets/NosanaBuildersChallengeAgents.jpg)

## Topic

Vibe coding and Deploying Mastra Agents to Nosana

## Description

This first step will be in running a basic AI agent and giving it some basic functionality. Participants will add a tool, for the tool calling capabilities of the agent. These are TypeScript functions, that will, for example, make API calls, or perform calculations. At the end of the challenge, participants will have a working agent, that they can deploy to Nosana.

## [Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra)

For this challenge we will be using Mastra to build our tool.

> Mastra is an opinionated TypeScript framework that helps you build AI applications and features quickly. It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations, and evals. You can run Mastra on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

### Required Reading

We recommend reading the following sections to get started with how to create an Agent and how to implement Tool Calling.

- <https://mastra.ai/en/docs/agents/overview>
- [Mastra Guide: Build an AI stock agent](https://mastra.ai/en/guides/guide/stock-agent)

## Get Started

To get started run the following command to start developing:
We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), but you can try npm, or bun if you prefer.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Credits

To deploy your agent, you will need credits.
You need to have registered via the [Luma Page](https://luma.com/nosana-buidlday-SG).
Registering via the [Luma Page](https://luma.com/nosana-buidlday-SG) is essential!

## Assignment

Read [README-3HOUR.md](./README-3HOUR.md) for details on the 3-Hour Challenge.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the [Nosana Agent Challenge](https://github.com/nosana-ai/agent-challenge)** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Install dependencies** with `pnpm install`
4. **Run the development server** with `pnpm run dev`
5. **Build your agent** using the Mastra framework

### How to build your Agent

Here we will describe the steps needed to build an agent.

#### Folder Structure

Provided in this repo, there is the `Weather Agent`.
This is a fully working agent that allows a user to chat with an LLM, and fetches real time weather data for the provided location.

There are two main folders we need to pay attention to:

- [src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/](./src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/)
- [src/mastra/agents/your-agents/](./src/mastra/agents/your-agent/)

In `src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/` you will find a complete example of a working agent. Complete with Agent definition, API calls, interface definition, basically everything needed to get a full fledged working agent up and running.
In `src/mastra/agents/your-agents/` you will find a bare bones example of the needed components, and imports to get started building your agent, we recommend you rename this folder, and it's files to get started.

Rename these files to represent the purpose of your agent and tools. You can use the [Weather Agent Example](#example:_weather_agent) as a guide until you are done with it, and then you can delete these files before submitting your final submission.

As a bonus, for the ambitious ones, we have also provided the [src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/weather-workflow.ts](./src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/weather-workflow.ts) file as an example. This file contains an example of how you can chain agents and tools to create a workflow, in this case, the user provides their location, and the agent retrieves the weather for the specified location, and suggests an itinerary.

### 3 Hour Challenge

For the 3 hour challenge, we have provided a tool to create a basic template to get you started quickly.

1. Calculator Agent
2. Crypto Price Agent
3. GitHub Stats Agent

Read more about it at [README-3HOUR.md](./README-3HOUR.md)

### LLM-Endpoint

Agents depend on an LLM to be able to do their work. Nosana will provide you with and enddpoint to use.

#### Nosana Endpoint

You can use the following endpoint for your agent:

```
MODEL_NAME_AT_ENDPOINT=qwen2.5:1.5b
API_BASE_URL= https://dashboard.nosana.com/jobs/GPVMUckqjKR6FwqnxDeDRqbn34BH7gAa5xWnWuNH1drf
```

### Testing your Agent

You can read the [Mastra Documentation: Playground](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/local-dev/mastra-dev) to learn more on how to test your agent locally.
Before deploying your agent to Nosana, it's crucial to thoroughly test it locally to ensure everything works as expected. Follow these steps to validate your agent:

**Local Testing:**

1. **Start the development server** with `pnpm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
2. **Test your agent's conversation flow** by interacting with it through the chat interface
3. **Verify tool functionality** by triggering scenarios that call your custom tools
4. **Check error handling** by providing invalid inputs or testing edge cases
5. **Monitor the console logs** to ensure there are no runtime errors or warnings

**Docker Testing:**
After building your Docker container, test it locally before pushing to the registry:

```bash
# Build your container
docker build -t yourusername/agent-challenge:latest .

# Run it locally with environment variables
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env yourusername/agent-challenge:latest

# Test the containerized agent at http://localhost:8080
```

Ensure your agent responds correctly and all tools function properly within the containerized environment. This step is critical as the Nosana deployment will use this exact container.

### Submission Requirements

#### 1. Code Development

- Fork this repository and develop your AI agent
- Your agent must include at least one custom tool (function)
- Include environment variable examples in a `.env.example` file

#### 2. Docker Container

- Create a `Dockerfile` for your agent
- Build and push your container to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry
- Container must be publicly accessible

##### Build, Run, Publish

Note: You'll need an account on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/)

```sh

# Build and tag
docker build -t yourusername/agent-challenge:latest .

# Run the container locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 yourusername/agent-challenge:latest

# Login
docker login

# Push
docker push yourusername/agent-challenge:latest
```

#### 3. Nosana Deployment

- Deploy your Docker container on Nosana
- Your agent must successfully run on the Nosana network
- Include the Nosana job ID or deployment link

##### Nosana Job Definition

We have included a Nosana job definition at <./nos_job_def/nosana_mastra.json>, that you can use to publish your agent to the Nosana network.
